# Prints disconnect from the bed mid-printing

Try any of the following suggestions:

* Use the heated bed feature of the Pro
* Apply some Glue Stick to the bed. Brands reported to work well: 3M Scotch, Elmer Purple. You can remove it later with wet wipe and dry it off with a paper towel.
* Cover the bed with Blue Painter's Tape 

Also, make sure your nozzle tip [is calibrated](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KP7YsxjqRKWcObV6CRK5-KZcS5CjOuIDcJkh4Ew4VcQ/edit).
